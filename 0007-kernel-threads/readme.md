# Linux Kernel Threads Tutorial

This tutorial provides a comprehensive explanation of **Kernel Processes**, **Threads**, and **Kernel Thread APIs** in Linux, including practical examples with `kthread_create` and related functions.

## 1. Kernel Processes and Threads

### What is a Kernel Process?
A **kernel process** (or kernel task) is a process that runs entirely in kernel mode and performs system-level operations. Unlike user-space processes, these do not have an associated user-space memory.

Kernel processes are responsible for handling tasks such as:
- Managing hardware devices.
- Handling I/O scheduling.
- Memory management.
- Networking tasks.

Examples of kernel processes include:
- `ksoftirqd`
- `kworker`
- `kthreadd`

### What is a Kernel Thread?
A **kernel thread** is a lightweight process managed by the kernel that can execute kernel code concurrently. It runs in kernel space only and cannot access user-space memory directly.

Kernel threads are often used for:
- Performing background work asynchronously.
- Offloading long-running kernel tasks.
- Managing driver-related periodic tasks.

## 2. Difference Between Kernel Process and Kernel Thread

| Feature | Kernel Process | Kernel Thread |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Execution Context | Kernel space | Kernel space |
| Memory | Independent address space | Shared kernel address space |
| Creation | Created during system initialization or dynamically | Created using APIs like `kthread_create()` |
| Scheduling | Managed by scheduler | Managed by scheduler (same as process) |
| Communication | Through kernel data structures | Through shared kernel data structures |
| Example | `ksoftirqd`, `kswapd` | Driver-specific threads |

---

## 3. Kernel Thread APIs

Linux provides a set of APIs to create, run, and manage kernel threads.

### Commonly Used Kernel Thread APIs

| API | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kthread_create(threadfn, data, namefmt, ...)` | Creates a new kernel thread but does **not start** it immediately. |
| `wake_up_process(task)` | Starts the created thread by waking it up. |
| `kthread_run(threadfn, data, namefmt, ...)` | Convenience function to create and start a thread in one call. |
| `kthread_should_stop()` | Used by the thread function to check if it should terminate. |
| `kthread_stop(task)` | Signals the thread to stop and waits for it to exit. |

---

## 4. Understanding `kthread_should_stop()`

The `kthread_should_stop()` API is used inside the thread function to determine if the kernel thread has been asked to stop.

### Prototype
```c
bool kthread_should_stop(void);
```

### Use Case
When a kernel thread is requested to stop (using `kthread_stop()`), the kernel sets an internal flag for that thread. Inside the thread’s main loop, you periodically call `kthread_should_stop()` to check this flag.

If it returns `true`, the thread should gracefully exit.

### Example
```c
int my_thread_fn(void *data)
{
    while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
        // Thread's work here
        pr_info("Thread running...\n");
        ssleep(1);
    }
    pr_info("Thread stopping...\n");
    return 0;
}
```
This ensures clean shutdown and avoids killing the thread forcefully.

## 5. Example: Creating a Kernel Thread in a Device Driver

Below is a simple Linux kernel module demonstrating how to create and manage a kernel thread.

### Source Code
```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/kthread.h>
#include <linux/delay.h>

static struct task_struct *my_thread;

static int my_kthread_fn(void *data)
{
    while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
        pr_info("Kernel thread running...\n");
        ssleep(2);
    }
    pr_info("Kernel thread stopping...\n");
    return 0;
}

static int __init kthread_example_init(void)
{
    pr_info("Loading Kernel Thread Example...\n");

    // Create the kernel thread (not started yet)
    my_thread = kthread_create(my_kthread_fn, NULL, "my_kthread");

    if (IS_ERR(my_thread)) {
        pr_err("Failed to create thread\n");
        return PTR_ERR(my_thread);
    }

    // Start the thread
    wake_up_process(my_thread);

    pr_info("Kernel thread created and running\n");
    return 0;
}

static void __exit kthread_example_exit(void)
{
    pr_info("Stopping kernel thread...\n");
    if (my_thread)
        kthread_stop(my_thread);
    pr_info("Module exit complete\n");
}

module_init(kthread_example_init);
module_exit(kthread_example_exit);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Example Kernel Module using kthread_create");
```

### How It Works
1. **Thread Creation** – `kthread_create()` allocates and prepares the kernel thread but does not run it immediately.
2. **Thread Start** – `wake_up_process()` schedules the thread for execution.
3. **Thread Loop** – Inside the thread function, we repeatedly perform tasks until `kthread_should_stop()` returns true.
4. **Thread Stop** – When the module is unloaded, `kthread_stop()` requests the thread to stop and waits for its termination.

---

### Build Instructions

1. Create a `Makefile` in the same directory:

```makefile
obj-m += kthread_example.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

2. Build and insert the module:
```bash
make
sudo insmod kthread_example.ko
dmesg | tail
```

3. Remove the module:
```bash
sudo rmmod kthread_example
dmesg | tail
```

## 6. Summary

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Kernel Process** | A process that runs in kernel space (e.g., `ksoftirqd`) |
| **Kernel Thread** | A lightweight process running only in kernel space |
| **`kthread_create()`** | Creates a kernel thread |
| **`wake_up_process()`** | Starts a thread created by `kthread_create()` |
| **`kthread_run()`** | Creates and runs a thread in a single call |
| **`kthread_should_stop()`** | Checks if a thread should stop |
| **`kthread_stop()`** | Stops a running thread |
